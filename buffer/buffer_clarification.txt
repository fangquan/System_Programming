Hey everybody,

Two quick clarifications for the Buffer assignment.  First, your exploit strings should not cause segmentation faults.  The following output of the buffer program is not valid:

Userid: jcarberr
Cookie: 0x12345678
Type string: <string>
Grrr!: getbuf returned 0x12345678
VALID
NICE JOB!
Ouch!: You caused a segmentation fault!
Better luck next time

More generally, it is not sufficient to receive the VALID NICE JOB! confirmation.  If your goal is to get the program to set or return a particular value, it must actually do this!  For example, in the level where your goal is to cause getbuf() to return the cookie value, the following output is possible:

Userid: jcarberr
Cookie: 0x12345678
Type string: <string>
Grr!: getbuf returned 0x0
VALID
NICE JOB!

However, the supplied exploit string did not cause getbuf() to return the cookie, even though it did prompt the VALID NICE JOB! message.


Second, it is not acceptable to jump directly to the validate() function calls.  The goal of this assignment is to understand the x86 program stack by manipulating and exploiting it - jumping directly to validate() in each phase circumvents the need for any such understanding, and you will not receive credit for solutions that do this.

Have a good long weekend!
