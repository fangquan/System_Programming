Hey CS033,

Here are some things that you will hopefully find helpful for Buffer:

First: objdump is a program which you can use to view the assembly code of an object file.  Run
objdump -d buffer > obj.txt
to disassemble the contents of the Buffer executable into obj.txt.  That file will then contain each function's name, with all of its instructions, and the addresses of those instructions.  It'll make a great reference as you step through gdb and concoct exploit strings.

Second: si is a gdb command which you can use to step over a single x86 instruction.  Step and next won't do this sometimes, but si never fails to do so.  Use this command well.

Have a pleasant Columbus day!
